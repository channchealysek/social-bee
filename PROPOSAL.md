# Project Name
SOCIAL-BEE

## Project Summary
It is a social networking site where users may interact with one another and publish and comment on one another's content. Users may register and log in before publishing, sharing, and interacting with other users' postings, just as on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites. People can help one another by publishing and commenting on each other's content. Therefore, when someone runs into a problem and is unable to come up with a solution, we may use social-bee to seek help from others. Everything will then become evident as a consequence.
